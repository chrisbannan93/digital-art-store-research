# Mockup Generation Rules (v1 Nursery Printable Kits)

## 1) Allowed room types
- Nursery room
- Baby room corner
- Child bedroom styled for nursery age range

## 2) Camera angle consistency rules
- Use calm, straight-on or slight-angle perspectives only.
- Keep horizon level (no dramatic tilt).
- Keep frame and wall perspective realistic.
- Across one SKU gallery, keep angle family consistent (hero + secondary should feel from same room language).

## 3) Frame usage rules
- Frames must be realistic and proportionate to print ratio shown.
- Within one SKU gallery, frame style family should stay consistent.
- No ornate/high-contrast novelty frames that distract from artwork.
- Trio mockups must show coherent frame spacing for layout guidance.

## 4) Lighting rules
- Soft natural lighting or soft neutral studio lighting only.
- Avoid hard shadows, blown highlights, or heavy vignettes.
- Keep white balance consistent across gallery assets for a SKU.
- Avoid dramatic color grading that changes artwork appearance.

## 5) Invalid mockup conditions
A mockup is invalid if any of the following apply:
- Non-nursery setting (office, kitchen, unrelated room theme).
- Distorted frame geometry or impossible perspective.
- Inconsistent lighting/grade versus other gallery images in the same SKU.
- Overprocessed look (oversaturation, heavy blur, harsh HDR effects).
- Visual elements that imply shipped physical frames/canvas included.
- AI-looking artifacts (warped furniture edges, mismatched shadows, impossible textures).

## 6) Avoiding AI-looking interiors (required practices)
- Use believable furniture scale and spacing.
- Maintain consistent light direction across objects.
- Check edge integrity (frames, skirting boards, furniture outlines).
- Avoid surreal object blends or duplicated decor patterns.
- Keep decor minimal and functional; no fantasy architecture.
