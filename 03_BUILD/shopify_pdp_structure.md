# Shopify PDP Structure Stub

## Purpose
Implementation scaffold for Shopify PDP section mapping.

## Source of Truth
- `00_ADMIN/BUILD_SPEC.md` section 4 (ordered PDP structure)
- `00_ADMIN/BUILD_SPEC.md` section 6 (copy blocks)
- `00_ADMIN/BUILD_SPEC.md` sections 7-8 (trust + policy placement)

## To Build
- Map each required section to Shopify blocks/components in exact order.
- Define Single vs Trio set-choice behavior in the set-selection block.
- Define where canonical digital-only and trust cluster copy appears near CTA.

## Deferred
- Any PDP sections not listed in BUILD_SPEC section 4.
