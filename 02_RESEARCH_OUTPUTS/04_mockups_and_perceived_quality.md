# 04_mockups_and_perceived_quality

## Summary
- High-quality, realistic visuals are essential for trust: soft natural lighting, subtle realistic shadows, and authentic nursery context make prints feel tangible and credible.
- Use multiple images per listing: minimum 5, target 6–8 when useful. Include hero, lifestyle, scale/size reference, set overview, and what’s-included infographic.
- Keep environments on-use-case: nursery and kids-bedroom scenes only in early phase; avoid unrelated adult rooms that reduce relevance.
- Different channels require different framing: 9:16 phone-first scenes for ads, square/4:5 detailed galleries for PDPs, simple consistent thumbnails for collections.
- Avoid trust-killers: unrealistic scale, faux metallic effects, heavy filters, uncanny AI rooms, and misleading composition or sizing cues.

## Deep insights
### Premium vs cheap visual perception
Trustworthy mockups emulate real photography: soft directional daylight, believable frame shadows, and simple backgrounds that keep focus on the artwork.
Cheap-looking mockups often show flat/harsh lighting, pasted-on frame feel, mismatched perspective, or cluttered staging.

### Realistic shadows and scale cues
Subtle cast shadows and familiar nursery objects (crib/changing table/shelf/plush toy) anchor realism and improve buyer confidence.
Scale cues should be explicit enough that buyers can infer likely print sizes without guessing.

### Consistency creates trust
Across early catalog, keep camera style, frame style, wall tone, and editing treatment consistent.
Use one visual system so products feel like a coherent branded line, not mixed sources.

### Required mockup count and image roles
- Baseline per product: 6 images.
- Practical floor: 5 images.
- Typical high-confidence range: 5–8 images.

Recommended sequence:
1. Hero mockup (believable in-room placement).
2. Lifestyle/context shot (nursery corner).
3. Set/grid overview (for bundles).
4. Size/ratio chart.
5. Download → print → frame instructions.
6. File contents / what’s included panel.

### Room types to prioritize
- Nursery (crib/changing table context).
- Toddler/kids bedroom.
- Kids playroom (selectively, still calm style).

Avoid in v1:
- Adult living room, office, kitchen, and unrelated lifestyle spaces.

### Channel-specific framing rules
- **Ads (9:16):** one dominant motif, high legibility at phone size, transformation-led composition, room context visible.
- **Product galleries (1:1 or 4:5):** complete informational sequence (hero/context/scale/inclusions/details).
- **Collection thumbnails:** simple, style-identifiable, uncluttered preview.

### Common mistakes to eliminate
- Unrealistic scale/perspective.
- Over-cluttered scenes and irrelevant props.
- No size cues.
- Inconsistent editing temperature or contrast.
- Faux-foil/heavy texture effects that misrepresent printable output.
- Ambiguous expectations (digital vs physical, frame inclusion, sizing).

### Repeatable first-10-product standard
Keep one frame family, one wall-tone family, and one lighting profile.
Only vary motif/style set content and composition format (single/trio/grid) while preserving consistent visual language.

### Tooling approach (phased)
- **v1 (fast/low-cost):** Canva/Photopea + curated high-res nursery backgrounds + reusable templates.
- **v1.5 (low-cost scale):** template subscriptions/freelance batch production with strict style QA.
- **v2+ (premium):** real-print photography or bespoke scenes once winners are validated.

## Decisions I should make now
- [ ] Lock one frame style/material and wall-tone baseline for first 10 SKUs.
- [ ] Set baseline image count to 6 per listing.
- [ ] Finalize mandatory gallery sequence and naming convention.
- [ ] Ban AI-generated room backgrounds in v1.
- [ ] Standardize output specs for PDP and ads before scaling production.

## What to put into CONTEXT_PACK (10 bullets max)
- Mockup style baseline (frame, wall, lighting, shadows).
- Allowed room types (nursery, kids bedroom, playroom).
- Minimum mockup set and required image sequence.
- Product image specs and ad image/video specs.
- Print-confidence assets required on every SKU.
- Do-not-use visual effects and trust-killer list.
- Editing consistency rules.
- Tooling stack by phase (v1/v1.5/v2).
- Labeling/disclaimer requirements for digital products.
- QA checklist before publish.

## Open questions / risks
- Balancing premium look with approachable realism for budget-sensitive buyers.
- Risk of inconsistency when multiple tools/designers contribute mockups.
- Potential performance variance by channel between lifestyle-heavy vs minimal compositions.
- Need for stronger trust signals before review/UGC base exists.

## Next actions (checklist)
- [ ] Publish one-page mockup style guide for first 10 SKUs.
- [ ] Prepare 2–3 reusable nursery room backgrounds with consistent angle/lighting.
- [ ] Build reusable templates for hero, lifestyle, grid, ratio chart, and what’s-included panels.
- [ ] Produce 6-image sets for initial SKUs and verify phone legibility.
- [ ] QA all listings for perspective/scale realism and editing consistency.
- [ ] Produce 9:16 ad variants using the same visual system.
- [ ] Add clear digital-download and frame-not-included disclosures.
- [ ] Define milestone for introducing real-print photos and later UGC.
