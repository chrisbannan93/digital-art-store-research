## Summary (5 bullets max)
- Build the PDP as a print-confidence funnel: outcome proof -> digital clarity -> print confidence -> risk reduction -> set choice -> CTA.
- Above the fold must answer in seconds: what it is, digital vs physical, what’s included, print confidence, and next click action.
- Use fixed image order to remove digital anxiety before deep scroll.
- Present Single vs Trio as a clear two-card choice with Trio framed as curated/best value (without shaming Single).
- With no reviews, replace social proof with process proof (realistic mockups, file breakdown, print steps, support-first clarity, plain license).

## Deep insights (detailed)
### Core CRO problem: digital product anxiety
Cold paid-social traffic usually fears:
- printing errors,
- size/ratio confusion,
- low trust from no shipping/no reviews,
- uncertainty about exactly what files are delivered.

PDP must remove fear in sequence:
1) Belonging/outcome,
2) Clarity (digital-only + instant),
3) Confidence (how to print),
4) Safety (support/guarantee),
5) Decision (Single vs Trio),
6) Action (add to cart).

### Launch reality without reviews
When social proof is missing, use process proof:
- realistic room mockups,
- “what’s included” visual grid,
- ratio chart,
- Download -> Print -> Frame panel,
- PRINT_ME_FIRST callout,
- support-first guarantee,
- plain-English license.

### PDP modular architecture (for Shopify build)
Recommended fixed block order:
- Hero module,
- Confidence module,
- Includes module,
- Size module,
- Trio value module,
- FAQ module,
- License module,
- Support/guarantee module,
- Optional cross-sell.

### Topic Q1) PDP template (exact structure)
#### Above the fold

- “Choose your set” two-card selector:
  - Single (Starter)
  - Trio (Best Value)
- Primary CTA + instant-delivery microcopy.
- Mini “What you get” bullets.
- Trust strip (real nurseries, print support, personal-use license).
- Sticky mobile ATC bar.

### Topic Q2) Product gallery order

4. Download -> Print -> Frame
5. Size/ratio chart
6. PRINT_ME_FIRST preview

### Topic Q3) Copy block system (ready to reuse)

- “What you get” bullets tailored per set.
- “How it works” 3-step copy.
- Print confidence mini-module.
- Plain-English personal-use license block.

### Topic Q4) Offer presentation (Single vs Trio)
Use a two-card choice with “who it’s for”:
- Single = starter/statement piece.
- Trio = finished coordinated wall with layout included.

Core language:
- curated set,
- coordinated prints,
- layout included,
- choose frame size later.

### Topic Q5) Friction killers
Neutralize “I can’t print this” via step panel + PRINT_ME_FIRST + support strip.
Neutralize “I don’t know sizes” via badges + ratio chart + “choose later” copy.
Neutralize regret/scam fear via transparent digital-only labeling, realistic visuals, and plain policy language.

### Topic Q6) A/B tests (max 3 early)
1. Hook framing above fold: calm outcome vs print-confidence.
2. Trio highlight vs neutral set presentation.
3. PRINT_ME_FIRST callout placement: above fold vs below fold.

## Decisions I should make now
- [ ] Choose architecture: one PDP with Single/Trio variants vs separate PDPs.
- [ ] Lock Trio recommendation style (Best Value tag + card highlight).
- [ ] Finalize support-first guarantee wording and refund conditions.
- [ ] Lock reusable FAQ and license block copy.
- [ ] Limit launch A/B program to 3 high-leverage tests only.

## What to put into CONTEXT_PACK (10 bullets max)
- PDP architecture choice (variants vs separate products).
- Locked Single/Trio pricing and trio save message.
- Guarantee wording and enforceable conditions.
- Exact ratio pack names and display format.
- Trio layout suggestion format.
- Brand trust line for PDP and ads.
- Collection naming system.
- Post-purchase print-help email stance.
- Final license text.
- Customization stance at launch.

## Open questions / risks
- Broad guarantees can invite refund abuse for digital goods.
- Variant implementation can confuse if gallery/content doesn't update clearly.
- Too much print detail above fold can overwhelm first-time buyers.
- Without reviews, any visual inconsistency harms trust quickly.
- Poor Single/Trio price gap can collapse bundle preference.

## Next actions (checklist)
- [ ] Lock PDP architecture choice.
- [ ] Lock pricing + Trio value anchor copy.
- [ ] Finalize support-first policy text.
- [ ] Build Shopify section stack in fixed order.
- [ ] Build gallery sequence templates for Single and Trio.
- [ ] Publish reusable FAQ + license modules.
- [ ] Launch only 3 A/B tests for first CRO sprint.
