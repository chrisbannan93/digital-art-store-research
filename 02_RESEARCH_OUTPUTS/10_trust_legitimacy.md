# 10_trust_legitimacy

## Summary (5 bullets max)
- For digital nursery printables, launch trust is driven more by clarity, deliverability proof, and support safety-net than review volume.
- Use a trust stack in this order: process proof -> visual proof -> language proof -> policy proof -> support proof.
- Make “digital-only + instant download” impossible to miss, then immediately reduce regret with PRINT_ME_FIRST, print guidance, and support-first guarantee.
- Position policies as conversion assets: short, human, specific, and framed around successful outcomes.
- Fast, visible support (clear SLA + contact path + automations) is the strongest substitute for missing reviews.

## Deep insights (detailed)
### 1) Trust without reviews
For instant digital products, buyers care less about shipping reassurance and more about legitimacy, usability, and regret protection.

What buyers scan for:
- Specificity (files, sizes, formats, print options)
- Predictability (what happens after checkout)
- Competence (clean structure, no contradictions)
- Safety net (support + enforceable guarantee)
- Transparency (digital-only + license clarity)

### 2) Trust signal stack (ranked)
#### Tier A: deliverability + competence
- Exact file manifest
- PRINT_ME_FIRST featured as a core system
- Zoomed quality/detail previews
- Clear print path options (home/local/online)
- Transparent delivery mechanics at checkout and email

#### Tier B: policy proof
- Support-first print success guarantee
- Plain-English personal-use license (3 bullets)

#### Tier C: support proof
- Visible support SLA and contact routes
- Compact help center with targeted articles

#### Tier D: language/design proof
- Calm, honest digital-only language
- No hype urgency or manipulative framing

### 3) Page-level trust placement rules
#### Above the fold
Must include:
- digital-only + instant download line
- PRINT_ME_FIRST mention
- support-first guarantee snippet
- primary nursery outcome visual

#### Near CTA
Include compact trust cluster:
- instant download format line
- PRINT_ME_FIRST included
- support SLA
- make-it-right wording

#### Mid-PDP
In this order:
1. What you receive (manifest)
2. How to print (path options)
3. Troubleshooting mini-FAQ

#### Footer/policies/cart/checkout
- Policies start with human summary then details
- Cart line item reinforces digital-only and immediate delivery behavior
- No new complex claims introduced in checkout

### 4) Language rules
Use:
- calm, specific, competence-oriented phrases
- plain language and short sentences
- concrete process cues (“download -> print -> frame”)

Avoid:
- fake urgency/countdowns/hype
- absolute perfection claims
- harsh “no refunds” tone without support path

### 5) Policies as trust assets
- Guarantee format: short summary -> process bullets -> window -> scope clarity.
- Delivery language repeated consistently across PDP/cart/checkout/email.
- License shown in short bullets near CTA + full policy below.

### 6) Support as trust substitute
- Present support before purchase.
- Promise only what SLA can reliably fulfill.
- Automate confidence emails:
  - order ready,
  - printing quickstart,
  - optional 24h help check-in.

### 7) Red flags to eliminate
- Hidden contact pathways
- Contradictory policies
- Cluttered/hypey UX patterns
- Inconsistent mockups or low-res media
- Delayed/unclear digital delivery communication

## Decisions I should make now
- [ ] Lock Print Success Guarantee window/conditions.
- [ ] Lock support SLA and staffing rhythm.
- [ ] Lock file manifest standards (formats, DPI, sizes).
