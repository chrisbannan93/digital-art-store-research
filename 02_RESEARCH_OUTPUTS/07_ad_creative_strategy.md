## Summary (5 bullets max)
- Launch with three creative angles: **Finished-wall transformation**, **Print-confidence**, and **Instant gift convenience** to balance conversion intent and early-trust constraints.
- Use one reusable 9:16 muted-friendly structure (12–15s) with hook in second 1, finished wall shown immediately, confidence cues before CTA.
- Keep visual language calm and legible: large on-screen text, minimal words, and simple step icons.
- Enforce safe-zone discipline so key text/CTA is not hidden by platform UI overlays.
- First batch should be 4 creatives: 2 transformation, 1 print-confidence, 1 gift angle, with hook swaps as primary variable.

## Deep insights (detailed)
### Zero-review reality: replace social proof with visual proof
At launch, creatives must establish trust quickly through:
- **Outcome proof:** finished wall shown first.
- **Simplicity proof:** concise “download → test → print” flow.
- **Safety proof:** print-confidence assets highlighted (especially `PRINT_ME_FIRST.pdf`).

### 1) Chosen creative angles (core)
#### Angle A — Finished-wall transformation
- Resolves: “The nursery feels unfinished.”
- Emotion: relief + pride.
- Execution: before/after parity shot + trio layout cue + short promise.

#### Angle B — Print-confidence (no-regret printing)
- Resolves: “What if it prints wrong?”
- Emotion: safety + control.
- Execution: show guide + ratios + 3-step print process without overloading detail.

#### Angle C — Instant gift / last-minute save
- Resolves: “I need something tasteful now.”
- Emotion: competence + convenience.
- Execution: gift-ready framing with explicit instant-download clarity.

### 2) Hook library (on-screen text)
#### Transformation hooks
- “Nursery wall: fixed.”
- “From blank → calm.”
- “Make it feel finished.”
- “The ‘something’s missing’ fix.”
- “A calm nursery in minutes.”

#### Print-confidence hooks
- “Print it with confidence.”
- “Try before you print.”
- “No guessing sizes.”
- “5 ratios included.”
- “Print test page inside.”

#### Bundle/value hooks
- “A matching trio kit.”
- “Coordinated. Done.”
- “One download. Full set.”
- “Instant nursery refresh.”
- “A gift you can send today.”

### 3) Ad structure rules (exact)
**Core format:** 9:16 MP4, ~14 seconds, muted-friendly.

Frame flow:
1. **0.0–1.0s:** hook + after-wall outcome.
2. **1.0–2.2s:** before-wall contrast.
3. **2.2–4.0s:** after-wall reaffirmed.
4. **4.0–6.5s:** kit clarity (trio set + layout cue).
5. **6.5–9.5s:** print-confidence cues.
6. **9.5–11.5s:** 3-step icons (Download → Test → Print).
7. **11.5–14.0s:** CTA (“Get the Trio Kit” + instant download).

Rules:
- Keep hooks to ~3–5 words for first-glance readability.
- Put critical text in safe zones only.
- Keep CTA consistent across batch unless intentionally testing CTA copy.

### 4) Platform usage rules
#### TikTok
- Slightly faster pacing and motion while retaining calm aesthetic.
- Prioritize Transformation + Gift angles for top-of-feed thumb-stop.

#### Meta (Reels/Stories/Feed)
- Slightly slower readability holds for clarity.
- Prioritize Print-confidence + Transformation angles.

Execution rule:
- Reuse base creative for speed, but export platform-tuned cuts.

### 5) What not to do (guardrails)
- No busy collage frames with unreadable micro-text.
- No loud/saturated color treatment that breaks calm promise.
- No fake UGC style unless showing real proof moments.
- No hypey/clickbait hooks or unprovable claims.
- No delayed digital-only clarity.
- No text placement under known UI overlay zones.

### 6) First creative batch (launch week)
1. **Creative 1:** Transformation — hook “Nursery wall: fixed.”
2. **Creative 2:** Transformation alt — hook “From blank → calm.”
3. **Creative 3:** Print-confidence — hook “Try before you print.”
4. **Creative 4:** Gift angle — hook “A gift you can send today.”

Variation rule: change one variable per variant (hook OR kit visual OR confidence-timing emphasis).

## Decisions I should make now
- [ ] Lock launch signature look (single palette family for first 4 ads).
- [ ] Decide if price appears in ads (yes/no, and frame placement if yes).
- [ ] Confirm all print-confidence claims are operationally true.
- [ ] Standardize one CTA phrase across launch batch.
- [ ] Finalize safe-zone template before exports.

## What to put into CONTEXT_PACK (10 bullets max)
- Chosen launch angles (Transformation / Print-confidence / Gift convenience).
- Hook shortlist for launch batch.
- Exact 14s frame structure.
- Platform pacing rules (TikTok vs Meta).
- Safe-zone text/CTA placement standard.
- Standard CTA phrase.
- “Digital-only” disclosure timing rule.
- Print-confidence claims allowed list.
- Launch batch composition (2 transformation, 1 confidence, 1 gift).
- Variant testing rule (one variable at a time).

## Open questions / risks
- Whether print-confidence claims are fully aligned with real fulfillment capabilities.
- Potential generic-template look if mockups are not distinctive enough.
- Risk of ad/pdp mismatch if landing pages don’t mirror simplicity cues.
- Unknown initial performance split between Trio-first and Single-first paths.

## Next actions (checklist)
- [ ] Pick 3 launch trio kits using one palette family.
- [ ] Build 9:16 safe-zone master template.
- [ ] Build and lock 14-second timeline once.
- [ ] Export 4 launch creatives using batch plan.
- [ ] Export TikTok and Meta pacing variants from same base edits.
- [ ] Ensure “Instant download” appears in first 2–3 seconds.
- [ ] QA phone-legibility and trim text until instant-readable.
- [ ] Launch only first batch and learn before expanding volume.
