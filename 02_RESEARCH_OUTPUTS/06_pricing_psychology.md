## Summary (5 bullets max)
- Locked launch pricing (AUD): Single **$12**, Trio Kit **$29**, Weekend Kit **$49** (Weekend as post-validation tier).
- Default commercial emphasis: lead with **Trio** as “Most Popular / Best Value”; keep Singles as a low-friction starter/style-test path.
- Anchor strategy should stay clean and trust-building: “Save $7 vs singles” + confidence-value language; avoid aggressive crossed-out pricing at launch.
- Buyer behavior is more **risk-sensitive** than pure price-sensitive, so confidence assets should be strengthened before discounting.
- Optimization sequence: if CTR is high but CVR low, fix trust/choice friction first; if CVR is healthy but CPA high, increase AOV via bundles/upsells before raising prices.

## Deep insights (detailed)
### A) What buyers are actually purchasing
In nursery printables, the buyer is purchasing a finished-room outcome, not a file object. Pricing must support:
- speed and decision relief,
- confidence in print execution,
- quality signal without “digital luxury” resistance.

### B) Market expectation baseline
Marketplace norms condition buyers to expect low-to-mid digital prices. A Shopify premium requires visible value through:
- print-confidence scaffolding,
- cohesive bundle logic,
- clearer mockups/guidance than commodity listings.

### C) Price calls (clear lock)
#### Single print: **$12 AUD**
- Under common impulse threshold while avoiding “cheap/throwaway file” signal.
- Functions as trust-builder and style test, not core revenue driver.

#### Trio Kit: **$29 AUD** (core offer)
- Sits under a strong mental threshold for same-day decor decisions.
- Supports clear internal anchor: 3 singles = $36, Trio = $29 (“Save $7”).
- Best balance of conversion comfort and AOV viability.

#### Weekend Kit (6–9): **$49 AUD** (future/scale)
- Positioned as project-completion kit under key $50 line.
- Reserved for validated demand phase, not initial complexity.

### D) Bundle emphasis rule: Single vs Trio
- Site/ad default should be Trio-first because buyers want a cohesive done-for-you decision.
- Singles remain available as fallback for price-anxious or skeptical buyers.
- Trio should be default path from paid social and carry “Most Popular / Best Value” framing.

### E) Anchoring language strategy
Use:
- “Save $7 vs buying singles.”
- “Print confidence included.”
- tier badges: Starter / Most Popular / Complete the Wall.

Avoid early:
- perpetual crossed-out pricing,
- exaggerated discount percentages,
- manipulative decoy pricing structures.

### F) Price sensitivity reality
- Risk-sensitive first (print uncertainty, taste fit, delivery confidence).
- Price should signal quality but stay below “too expensive for digital” resistance bands.

### G) Common pricing errors to avoid
- Underpricing singles to chase volume (attracts low-intent bargain traffic).
- No default choice architecture (causes decision stall).
- Discount-first launch without trust scaffolding.
- Complex offer page that obscures what is included.

### H) Evolution playbook
- **High CTR, low CVR:** improve trust/clarity + simplify choice before price cuts.
- **Good CVR, high CPA:** lift AOV via bundles/add-ons before raising prices.
- **Support load rising:** tighten print guidance and consider modest price lift to filter low-intent demand.

## Decisions I should make now
- [ ] Lock launch prices in Shopify: Single $12 / Trio $29 / Weekend $49 placeholder.
- [ ] Make Trio default in navigation, hero sections, and ad landing.
- [ ] Set anchor copy under Trio: “Save $7 vs buying singles.”
- [ ] Decide launch promo stance: clean no-discount vs finite launch offer.
- [ ] Keep risk-reducer block above fold on Trio PDP.

## What to put into CONTEXT_PACK (10 bullets max)
- Pricing ladder (AUD): $12 / $29 / $49.
- Trio is default “Most Popular / Best Value” landing destination.
- Singles are starter/style-test path, not primary growth lever.
- Bundle anchor language: “Save $7 vs singles.”
- Avoid aggressive crossed-out launch pricing.
- Confidence assets must be visible near price.
- Risk-sensitive-buyer principle drives conversion strategy.
- If CTR high + CVR low: fix trust/choice before discounting.

## Open questions / risks
- Expected paid-social CPA range for cold nursery traffic.
- Buyer mix split: self-buy parents vs gift buyers.
- Adequacy of confidence modules to justify premium over marketplace norms.
- Support workload impact from post-purchase print help commitments.
- Long-term defensibility of premium position vs template commoditization.
