## Summary (5 bullets max)
- Minimum viable premium offer: one artwork/kit delivered as a single ZIP containing 5 print-ready 300-DPI JPG ratio files plus a 1-page `PRINT_ME_FIRST.pdf` confidence guide.
- Keep perceived risk low through support-first clarity: help buyers pick the right file or resolve printer issues before refund decisions.
- Launch bundle structure should mirror nursery buying decisions: Single hero print, Trio kit, then Weekend Kit (6–9 prints) after validation.
- Reduce conversion friction with mandatory visuals: “What’s included” grid, “Choose your frame size” cheat image, and compact FAQ directly below add-to-cart.
- Start with plain-English Personal Use licensing only at launch; repeat license rules in product page and included guide.

## Deep insights (detailed)
### The core problem to solve
Buyers are not primarily asking if the art is pretty; they are asking if they can reliably reproduce the mockup outcome.
Top anxieties:
- What exactly do I receive?
- Which file fits my frame?
- Will print quality hold up?
- Is delivery/download straightforward?

### Q1) Minimum viable digital offer that still feels premium
Recommended default per single-artwork SKU:
- One ZIP download.
- 5 JPG files at 300 DPI:
  - 2:3
  - 3:4
  - 4:5
  - 11×14
  - ISO A-series
- `PRINT_ME_FIRST.pdf` (1 page): frame-size match, print options, key tips, and digital-only/license reminders.

Why this structure works:
- Matches buyer expectations in printable-art workflows.
- Reduces support complexity vs too many formats.
- Gives enough flexibility for common frame ecosystems.

What to avoid at launch:
- Layered/pro files (PSD/AI), transparency variants, or oversized file sprawl.
- Commercial-use licensing in baseline SKU.
- Mega-bundle quantity positioning that weakens premium curation signal.

### Q2) Bundle structures
#### A) Single artwork (MVP)
- 1 design + 5 ratio JPGs + confidence guide.
- Positioning: “anchor print for a calm nursery wall.”

#### B) Small bundles (best early value ladder)
- **Trio Kit (3 prints):** coordinated set + layout suggestion image.
- **Pair Kit (2 prints):** compact-wall option where relevant.

#### C) Collections later (after validation)
- **Weekend Kit (6–9 prints):** hero + supporting pieces + optional layout options.
- Add extras only after signal (frame guide, palette card, expanded layouts).

### Q3) Product-page explanation model
Required clarity blocks:
- “Digital download only (no physical item shipped)” in title/first line/image badge.
- 3-step process: Download → Choose file by frame size → Print.
- Visuals:
  - What’s included grid (ratio tiles + 300 DPI badge)
  - Frame-size cheat map
  - Detail crop for print-quality confidence
- FAQ immediately under add-to-cart:
  - physical vs digital,
  - print sizes,
  - print workflow,
  - refund handling,
  - licensing limits.

### Q4) Guarantees / risk reducers
Adopt support-first guarantee:
- Help choose the correct file/size.
- Resolve download/print issues quickly.
- Refund only when genuine issues cannot be resolved.

Low-cost trust lever:
- Offer “right-size help” within a fixed post-purchase window.

### Q5) Licensing stance (initial)
Use Personal Use Only language in plain English:
- Allowed: print for own home or personal gifting.
- Not allowed: resale, redistribution, file sharing, commercial product use.

### Q6) Offer mistakes to avoid
- Weak digital-only clarity.
- Ambiguous sizing story.
- Aggressive no-refunds tone without support pathway.
- Overpromised visual effects not representative of real print output.
- Curation drift into mega-bundle/low-trust positioning.

## Decisions I should make now
- [ ] Lock default 5-file ratio pack for every SKU.
- [ ] Finalize support-first guarantee wording and placement.
- [ ] Launch with Singles + Trio Kits; defer larger collections until signal.
- [ ] Keep launch licensing as Personal Use Only.
- [ ] Standardize ZIP naming and `PRINT_ME_FIRST.pdf` format across all products.

## What to put into CONTEXT_PACK (10 bullets max)
- Standard deliverable: 1 ZIP with 5 ratio JPGs + confidence guide.
- Ratio standard: 2:3 / 3:4 / 4:5 / 11×14 / A-series.
- Digital-only message must appear in title, first line, and image badge.
- Mandatory “What’s included” and “Choose your frame size” visuals.
- Support-first guarantee flow (help/fix/refund-if-unresolved).
- Shopify download setup with resend/re-download support.
- Personal-use-only licensing baseline.
- Bundle ladder: Single → Trio → Weekend Kit (later).
- Standard internal ZIP/folder naming convention.
- Product-page FAQ block required under add-to-cart.

## Open questions / risks
- Which converts faster in paid social first: Singles (impulse) or Trio (value)?
- How much print guidance is helpful before it becomes clutter?
- What support capacity exists for resize/help requests?
- Whether jurisdiction-specific digital-consent language is needed sooner.

## Next actions (checklist)
- [ ] Create reusable ZIP template structure and naming convention.
- [ ] Draft `PRINT_ME_FIRST.pdf` one-page standard.
- [ ] Design evergreen “What’s Included” and “Frame Size Cheat” images.
- [ ] Finalize support-first guarantee and digital refund clause copy.
- [ ] Configure and test Shopify Digital Downloads delivery on mobile + desktop.
- [ ] Launch initial matrix: 3 Singles + 2 Trio Kits and monitor conversion signal.

- Printable marketplace delivery/ratio conventions.
- Shopify digital-download operational patterns.
- Digital product expectation norms around support-first issue resolution.
