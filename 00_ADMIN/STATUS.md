# Research OS Status

## Project Phase
- **Current phase:** BUILD_READY
- **Research mode:** STOPPED

## Decision Checklist (DR-01 to DR-10, COMPLETE)
- [x] DR-01 — Bundle-first merchandising
- [x] DR-02 — Print-confidence system required
- [x] DR-03 — Platform-specific creative framing
- [x] DR-04 — Mockup realism and quality standards
- [x] DR-05 — Offer architecture and anti-commoditization guardrails
- [x] DR-06 — Pricing lock and value framing
- [x] DR-07 — Ad creative launch constraints
- [x] DR-08 — Two-gate testing and CPA guardrails
- [x] DR-09 — PDP conversion structure and launch A/B cap
- [x] DR-10 — Trust, policy posture, and digital-only language lock

## Build Handoff Status
- **Build authority:** `00_ADMIN/BUILD_SPEC.md`
- **Implementation stubs prepared:** `03_BUILD/*`
- **Research mode directive:** No additional topic runs required before v1 build execution.

## Next Up
- Execute v1 implementation from BUILD_SPEC:
  1. PDP structure and copy modules
  2. Product schema wiring
  3. Gallery asset production
  4. Policy pages and guarantee language
  5. SKU packaging and QA

## Stop Conditions
- Stop if implementation deviates from locked BUILD_SPEC constraints.
- Stop if deliverables cannot meet print-confidence requirements (`PRINT_ME_FIRST`, ratio coverage, manifest clarity).
- Stop and revisit strategy if unit economics fail under locked CPA guardrails after minimum data thresholds.
