## Core Paid Ads + Ecommerce Metrics

### CTR (Click-Through Rate)
Percentage of impressions that result in a click. Higher CTR often indicates stronger hook-message-creative fit.

### CPC (Cost Per Click)
Average amount paid per click. Lower CPC can indicate efficient traffic acquisition, but quality still matters.

### CPM (Cost Per Mille)
Cost per 1,000 impressions. Useful for understanding auction pressure and creative resonance in paid social.

### CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)
Average cost to acquire one purchase. Must be evaluated against gross margin and AOV.

### CVR (Conversion Rate)
Percentage of visitors who purchase. Product page quality, trust, price, and offer strength heavily influence this.

### AOV (Average Order Value)
Average revenue per order. Bundles, upsells, and pricing architecture are key AOV levers.

### ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)
Revenue divided by ad spend. Helpful directional metric, but should be paired with margin-aware metrics.

### MER (Marketing Efficiency Ratio)
Total revenue divided by total marketing spend across channels. A blended view of marketing efficiency.

### Add-to-Cart Rate
Percentage of sessions that add at least one item to cart. Indicates product/offer interest before checkout friction.

### Checkout Initiated Rate
Percentage of sessions that begin checkout. Helps isolate where funnel drop-off happens after cart intent.

## Creative + Strategy Terms

### Creative Fatigue
Performance decline when audiences repeatedly see similar ads; often signaled by dropping CTR and rising CPC/CPA.

### UGC (User-Generated Content)
Creative style mimicking authentic customer-created media; often used to increase relatability and trust.

### Hooks
The opening line/visual that captures attention in the first seconds of an ad or first glance of a static creative.

### Angles
Distinct persuasive framing for the same product (e.g., budget transformation, renter-friendly decor, giftable bundle).

## Shopify + Catalog Structure

### Shopify Collections vs Products
- **Product:** Individual sellable item (single print set or bundle listing).
- **Collection:** Grouping of products by theme, room, style, or campaign intent.

## Digital Download Licensing

### Personal Use License
Allows buyer to print for personal display/use, but not to resell, redistribute, or use commercially.

### Commercial Use License
Allows specified business/commercial usage rights under defined terms and limits.

### License Clarity Best Practice
State what is allowed, what is prohibited, and whether extended rights can be purchased separately.
