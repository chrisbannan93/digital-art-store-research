## Research Decisions (from Topic 01)

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Use a bundle-first merchandising model for early tests (kits/sets before single-file emphasis).
- **Why:** Buyers appear to purchase finished-room outcomes and reduced decision fatigue rather than isolated files.
- **Evidence:** Topic 01 output highlights persistent bundle/set demand patterns and stronger solution framing.
- **Tradeoffs:** More upfront curation and mockup production work per launch.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit if bundle CVR or AOV uplift is not observed after two testing cycles.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Build a print-confidence system as a non-negotiable conversion component.
- **Why:** Execution anxiety (sizes, DPI, colour expectations, download flow) is the core friction in digital art purchases.
- **Evidence:** Topic 01 identifies recurring buyer concerns and post-purchase confusion risks.
- **Tradeoffs:** Additional documentation and support flow setup required before launch.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit if support tickets stay low and conversion remains strong without expanded guidance.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Run platform-specific creative framing: TikTok transformation-first, Meta proof/bundle-first.
- **Why:** Buyer psychology and format behaviour differ by platform; one unified creative style is likely suboptimal.
- **Evidence:** Topic 01 platform-fit recommendations by niche and ad behaviour patterns.
- **Tradeoffs:** Higher creative ops complexity across channels.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit if channel-level CPA and CTR do not diverge meaningfully after controlled tests.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** No text-heavy art in the first drop unless readability is validated at target print sizes.
- **Why:** Readability failure destroys perceived quality and increases refund/support pressure.
- **Evidence:** Topic 03 analysis flags small-text poster risk and print-confidence sensitivity.
- **Tradeoffs:** Reduces stylistic variety in early catalog.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit after readability QA and positive buyer feedback on legibility.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Do not use mega-bundle quantity positioning in launch creative or listings.
- **Why:** Quantity-first framing drives commoditization and undermines curated outcome positioning.
- **Evidence:** Topic 03 identifies mega-bundle market behavior as a race-to-the-bottom risk.
- **Tradeoffs:** May reduce top-of-funnel attraction from bargain-seeking traffic.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit only if curated bundle positioning fails to achieve target CPA and CVR.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28

- **Evidence:** Topic 04 identifies AI-looking interiors as a recurring trust-killer.
- **Tradeoffs:** Slightly slower mockup throughput versus fully generative pipelines.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit after strong conversion trust signals and a validated realism QA process.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Set minimum 6-image mockup standard per nursery listing.
- **Why:** Buyers need visual proof for outcome, scale, and execution confidence.
- **Evidence:** Topic 04 synthesis recommends 5–8 images, with <3 increasing uncertainty.
- **Tradeoffs:** More production effort per SKU before publish.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit if conversion remains strong with fewer images in controlled tests.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Personal-use license only at launch (no commercial-use option).

- **Tradeoffs:** Some highly price-sensitive buyers may need extra reassurance before purchasing.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit if Trio landing underperforms Single landing in controlled split tests.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Use clean anchor copy (“Save $7 vs singles”) and avoid aggressive crossed-out launch pricing.
- **Why:** Early trust is fragile; transparent anchor math outperforms gimmicky discount optics for new stores.
- **Evidence:** Topic 06 flags heavy discount presentation as a trust-killer at launch.
- **Tradeoffs:** Slightly lower urgency versus hard-promo tactics.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit if validated urgency experiments show significantly better net profitability.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Launch creative system will use exactly three angles: Transformation, Print-confidence, and Instant gift convenience.
- **Why:** Balances emotional outcome proof with trust-building for zero-review launch conditions.
- **Evidence:** Topic 07 output prioritizes these angles as highest-leverage and lowest-trust-risk combination.
- **Tradeoffs:** Narrower angle diversity in first batch.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit after first creative cycle if one angle consistently underperforms.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Standardize launch ad format to 9:16, ~14s, with finished-wall outcome shown in first second.
- **Why:** Early thumb-stop and immediate outcome clarity are essential for cold-feed performance.
- **Evidence:** Topic 07 prescribes first-second outcome framing with concise sequence and confidence cues.
- **Tradeoffs:** Less experimentation with long-form storytelling at launch.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit after stable CTR and hold-rate data from first two testing rounds.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Enforce safe-zone text placement and digital-only disclosure in first 2–3 seconds across all ad variants.
- **Why:** Prevents UI overlap loss and reduces digital-format confusion that harms trust and conversion.
- **Evidence:** Topic 07 and prior trust findings highlight overlay issues and format confusion as conversion killers.
- **Tradeoffs:** Tighter layout constraints during creative production.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit only if platform UI guidance changes or readability tests justify adjustments.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Adopt a strict two-gate testing model (Gate 1 CTR/CPC, Gate 2 CVR/CPA) for all cold paid-social creative tests.
- **Why:** Prevents killing strong concepts too early or scaling click-only creatives that do not convert.
- **Evidence:** DR-08 framework defines this as fastest reliable loop under low-volume launch conditions.
- **Tradeoffs:** Slightly slower emotional decision-making in exchange for cleaner signal quality.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit if account volume grows enough to support tighter/shorter decision windows.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Use ABO/ad-group budget parity with 2 creatives per angle in Sprint 1 tests.
- **Why:** Ensures angle-level fairness and reduces one-creative luck bias.
- **Evidence:** DR-08 specifies equal-spend structure as cleanest way to compare angles.
- **Tradeoffs:** Less algorithmic flexibility during initial learning phase.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit after one angle is validated and scaling phase begins.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Anchor CPA targets to Trio price: tCPA = 0.7P, maxCPA = 1.0P, stop if >1.3P after minimum data.
- **Why:** Keeps performance decisions tied to business economics rather than vanity metrics.
- **Evidence:** DR-08 provides explicit economic guardrails using trio price as anchor.
- **Tradeoffs:** Tight constraints may pause spend quickly on volatile low-budget days.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit after stable CVR and AOV improvements are demonstrated.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** PDP must follow a fixed print-confidence funnel order (outcome -> clarity -> confidence -> safety -> set choice -> CTA).
- **Why:** Digital-product anxiety is the core conversion blocker for cold nursery traffic.
- **Evidence:** DR-09 identifies sequence-based fear removal as primary CRO mechanism.
- **Tradeoffs:** Less freedom for creative storytelling on PDP layout.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit after meaningful review/UGC volume reduces trust burden.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Trio is explicitly labeled “Most Popular / Best Value” in set-choice block; Single remains available as Starter.
- **Why:** Improves choice clarity and supports AOV without removing low-friction entry path.
- **Evidence:** DR-09 recommends dual-card architecture with Trio default emphasis.
- **Tradeoffs:** Requires clean value messaging to avoid Single cannibalization confusion.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit if Trio share underperforms despite stable traffic and pricing.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Launch CRO program is capped at three A/B tests (hook framing, Trio highlight, PRINT_ME_FIRST placement).
- **Why:** Prevents over-testing noise and keeps learning loops interpretable at low volume.
- **Evidence:** DR-09 specifies these as highest-leverage early PDP experiments.
- **Tradeoffs:** Slower exploration of secondary UX hypotheses.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit after baseline conversion stabilizes and traffic volume increases.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Trust at launch will prioritize process proof over review volume (manifest, PRINT_ME_FIRST, print-path clarity, support SLA).
- **Why:** Digital nursery buyers are regret- and usability-sensitive before they are review-sensitive.
- **Evidence:** DR-10 identifies clarity/deliverability/support as primary trust drivers in zero-review conditions.
- **Tradeoffs:** More upfront operational documentation and support setup work.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit after meaningful review volume materially changes conversion behavior.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Enforce canonical digital-delivery language across funnel: "Digital download only. No physical item is shipped."
- **Why:** Reduces scam suspicion and buyer confusion at key decision moments.
- **Evidence:** DR-10 flags inconsistent digital-only messaging as a critical trust failure point.
- **Tradeoffs:** Requires strict copy QA across ads, PDP, cart, checkout, and emails.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit only if delivery model changes to include physical variants by default.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Policy pages must be conversion-supportive (human summary first, then details) and support-first guarantee is positioned near CTA.
- **Why:** Legal-first policy framing increases anxiety; clarity-first framing improves perceived safety and action confidence.
- **Evidence:** DR-10 policy-positioning guidance prioritizes outcome reassurance over legal intimidation.
- **Tradeoffs:** Ongoing maintenance needed to keep summaries aligned with full policy text.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit if legal/compliance requirements force stricter front-loaded disclosures.
