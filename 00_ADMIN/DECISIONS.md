## Placeholder Decisions

- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Decision:** Start with digital download printable wall art before physical POD expansion.
- **Why:** Faster iteration cycle, no inventory risk, and simpler operations while validating demand.
- **Evidence:** Initial model prioritizes speed of testing creative and pricing with paid social traffic.
- **Tradeoffs:** Lower perceived value versus physical prints for some buyers.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit once we hit stable conversion targets and repeat buyer signals.

- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Decision:** Prioritize one niche collection before broad catalog expansion.
- **Why:** Clearer ad messaging, better audience learning, and tighter product-market fit loop.
- **Evidence:** Niche focus generally improves creative relevance and conversion clarity.
- **Tradeoffs:** Slower top-line exploration across multiple categories.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit after first profitable niche reaches creative fatigue.

- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Decision:** Use static and short-form video mockup creatives as primary ad inputs.
- **Why:** Visual products need instant perceived quality and room-context demonstration.
- **Evidence:** Art products are highly creative-sensitive in paid social feeds.
- **Tradeoffs:** Ongoing production workload for fresh creatives.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit if CTR and CVR stay below targets after two creative cycles.

## Research Decisions (from Topic 01)

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Use a bundle-first merchandising model for early tests (kits/sets before single-file emphasis).
- **Why:** Buyers appear to purchase finished-room outcomes and reduced decision fatigue rather than isolated files.
- **Evidence:** Topic 01 output highlights persistent bundle/set demand patterns and stronger solution framing.
- **Tradeoffs:** More upfront curation and mockup production work per launch.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit if bundle CVR or AOV uplift is not observed after two testing cycles.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Build a print-confidence system as a non-negotiable conversion component.
- **Why:** Execution anxiety (sizes, DPI, colour expectations, download flow) is the core friction in digital art purchases.
- **Evidence:** Topic 01 identifies recurring buyer concerns and post-purchase confusion risks.
- **Tradeoffs:** Additional documentation and support flow setup required before launch.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit if support tickets stay low and conversion remains strong without expanded guidance.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Run platform-specific creative framing: TikTok transformation-first, Meta proof/bundle-first.
- **Why:** Buyer psychology and format behaviour differ by platform; one unified creative style is likely suboptimal.
- **Evidence:** Topic 01 platform-fit recommendations by niche and ad behaviour patterns.
- **Tradeoffs:** Higher creative ops complexity across channels.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit if channel-level CPA and CTR do not diverge meaningfully after controlled tests.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** No text-heavy art in the first drop unless readability is validated at target print sizes.
- **Why:** Readability failure destroys perceived quality and increases refund/support pressure.
- **Evidence:** Topic 03 analysis flags small-text poster risk and print-confidence sensitivity.
- **Tradeoffs:** Reduces stylistic variety in early catalog.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit after readability QA and positive buyer feedback on legibility.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Do not use mega-bundle quantity positioning in launch creative or listings.
- **Why:** Quantity-first framing drives commoditization and undermines curated outcome positioning.
- **Evidence:** Topic 03 identifies mega-bundle market behavior as a race-to-the-bottom risk.
- **Tradeoffs:** May reduce top-of-funnel attraction from bargain-seeking traffic.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit only if curated bundle positioning fails to achieve target CPA and CVR.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** No faux-foil/metallic-look hero products in first nursery drop.
- **Why:** Visual-output mismatch risk undermines trust and conversion confidence.
- **Evidence:** Topic 03 identifies frequent foil-look disclaimer friction in nursery printable shopping behavior.
- **Tradeoffs:** Removes one popular aesthetic lane from early catalog.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit after strong trust metrics and validated print-consistency proof.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Limit launch catalog to three nursery visual archetypes with strict palette discipline.
- **Why:** Cohesive system positioning outperforms random-style catalogs for bundled wall outcomes.
- **Evidence:** Topic 03 recommends calm, cohesive, low-detail visuals with phone-readable consistency.
- **Tradeoffs:** Slower stylistic exploration in exchange for stronger brand clarity.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit after first 10 SKUs and two creative cycles are evaluated.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** No AI-generated room backgrounds in v1 mockups.
- **Why:** Uncanny or overly perfect scenes reduce trust and can trigger scam anxiety.
- **Evidence:** Topic 04 identifies AI-looking interiors as a recurring trust-killer.
- **Tradeoffs:** Slightly slower mockup throughput versus fully generative pipelines.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit after strong conversion trust signals and a validated realism QA process.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Set minimum 6-image mockup standard per nursery listing.
- **Why:** Buyers need visual proof for outcome, scale, and execution confidence.
- **Evidence:** Topic 04 synthesis recommends 5–8 images, with <3 increasing uncertainty.
- **Tradeoffs:** More production effort per SKU before publish.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit if conversion remains strong with fewer images in controlled tests.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Personal-use license only at launch (no commercial-use option).
- **Why:** Keeps offer simple, reduces abuse/policing overhead, and aligns with target home-decor buyer intent.
- **Evidence:** Topic 05 recommends avoiding commercial-license complexity in early phase.
- **Tradeoffs:** Excludes potential commercial buyers in early revenue mix.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit after stable conversion and support operations are proven.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Standardize every SKU to one ZIP with 5 ratio JPGs + `PRINT_ME_FIRST.pdf`.
- **Why:** Reduces buyer confusion and support volume while preserving premium clarity.
- **Evidence:** Topic 05 indicates the 5-ratio pack is widely understood and confidence-building.
- **Tradeoffs:** Less customization flexibility in initial catalog.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit if support requests indicate missing critical size needs.

- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Decision:** Launch offer ladder is Singles + Trio Kits only; defer Weekend Kits until signal.
- **Why:** Keeps merchandising focused and allows clear validation before expanding complexity.
- **Evidence:** Topic 05 recommends small curated bundles before larger collections.
- **Tradeoffs:** Slower AOV expansion initially versus launching large kits immediately.
- **Revisit trigger:** Revisit after first conversion/cohort data supports larger bundle demand.
