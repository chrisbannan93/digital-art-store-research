# RUN LOOP

Use this checklist for every topic (01–15).

## Per-topic checklist
- [ ] Open the topic prompt in `01_RESEARCH_PROMPTS/`.
- [ ] Copy/paste the prompt into ChatGPT.
- [ ] Review output and ensure required sections are present.
- [ ] Paste the response into matching file in `02_RESEARCH_OUTPUTS/`.
- [ ] Extract the **Context Pack Updates** section into `00_ADMIN/CONTEXT_PACK.md`.
- [ ] Log any non-trivial choice in `00_ADMIN/DECISIONS.md` (date + why + evidence + tradeoffs).
- [ ] Tick the completed topic in `00_ADMIN/STATUS.md`.
- [ ] Choose the next topic and repeat.

## Quality gate before moving to next topic
- [ ] At least 1 actionable decision was produced.
- [ ] Context pack got clearer (not longer and more vague).
- [ ] Next actions are specific and owner-ready.

## When to stop researching and start building
Start building when all are true:
- [ ] You have completed Topics 01–10 minimum (or enough to remove major uncertainty).
- [ ] Niche, buyer, promise, and offer structure are stable in `CONTEXT_PACK.md`.
- [ ] Pricing and testing rules are defined clearly enough to launch ads.
- [ ] Legal/licensing stance is clear enough to publish products.
- [ ] `00_ADMIN/BUILD_SPEC.md` is filled with concrete decisions, not TBDs.
