# CONTEXT PACK

## PLACEHOLDERS (replace as research validates)

## Niche
TBD (testing)

## Buyer
- Job to be done (provisional): “Help me make my wall feel finished this weekend without overspending.”
- Motivations observed: fast room transformation, identity expression, reduced decision fatigue.
- Key anxiety cluster: print success confidence (sizes, colour, file access, framing fit).

## Promise
Turn blank walls into cohesive, personality-led spaces quickly with instant-download kits that are easy to print.

## Visual Rules
- Prioritize finished-wall clarity in first image (believable above-crib/changing-table scale).
- Keep nursery visuals calm and phone-legible: one dominant motif + generous negative space.
- Restrict first 10 SKUs to 2–3 palette families (warm neutral, soft sage, terracotta accent).
- Use cohesive set visuals (trio/grid) to signal bundle value instantly.
- Put print-confidence cues (sizes/ratios/steps) in first 2–3 images and ad flow.

## Mockup Rules
- Use soft natural lighting with subtle realistic frame shadows; avoid flat or harsh lighting.
- Keep scale believable (above-crib/changing-table proportions and breathable spacing).
- Maintain consistent frame family, wall tone, camera angle style, and editing profile.
- Include explicit print-confidence cues (sizes/ratios + download→print→frame guidance).
- Avoid uncanny AI-style interiors or over-stylized scenes in v1.

## Offer Contents

## Anchoring Language
- Use clear value anchor: **“Save $7 vs buying singles.”**

## Ad Structure Rules
- **Core format:** 9:16 MP4 slideshow, 12–15s (standardize at ~14s).
- **Frame order:** Hook+After → Before → After reaffirmed → What’s included → Print-confidence → 3-step flow → CTA.
- **Readability rule:** 3–5 words in hook frames; large text; muted-friendly communication.
- **Disclosure rule:** “Instant download / digital-only” must appear in first 2–3 seconds.
- **Safe-zone rule:** keep critical text/CTA clear of platform UI overlay areas.

## Platform Usage Rules
- **TikTok:** slightly faster cuts and motion; prioritize Transformation + Gift angles early.
- **Meta Reels/Stories/Feed:** slightly calmer pacing; prioritize Print-confidence + Transformation.
- **Reuse rule:** build one master timeline, then export platform-specific pacing variants.
- **Testing rule:** first batch = 4 creatives (2 transformation, 1 print-confidence, 1 gift) with one-variable changes only.

## Key Objections + Answers (placeholder)
- **Objection:** “Will this actually print clearly?”  
  **Answer:** Use 300 DPI files + simple print settings + troubleshooting guide.
- **Objection:** “I don’t know which size to print.”  
  **Answer:** Include a size map tied to common frame dimensions.
- **Objection:** “Is this license personal or commercial?”  
  **Answer:** Show plain-language license summary before add-to-cart.
- **Objection:** “Digital files feel less valuable than physical prints.”  
  **Answer:** Emphasise instant access, low-risk experimentation, and room transformation outcome.
- **Objection:** “What if the style doesn’t match my room?”  
  **Answer:** Show multiple room-context mockups and cohesive themed kits.

## Testing Plan (placeholder budget + kill rules)
- **Starting budget:** TBD (suggested placeholder: $50–$100/day).
- **Test window:** TBD (suggested placeholder: 5–7 days per round).
- **Kill rule 1:** Pause creatives below CTR target after minimum spend threshold is reached.
- **Kill rule 2:** Pause ad sets where CPA exceeds allowable range versus AOV/margin.
- **Scale trigger:** Increase spend only when CTR + CVR + CPA are stable for multiple days.
- **Platform split (provisional):** TikTok transformation creatives + Meta proof/bundle creatives.

## Chosen Visual Archetypes
- **Soft Icon Trio (Sun / Moon / Cloud):** one large motif per print, high whitespace, calm nursery-safe read.
- **Watercolor Woodland Neutrals:** single-subject portraits, muted earthy tones, restrained detail for mobile legibility.
- **Terracotta Boho Minimal (No Faux-Foil):** modern warm palette, simple geometric/motif language, low-noise composition.

## Do Not Do (first-drop constraints)
- Do not ship faux-foil/metallic hero visuals that may not match printed output.
- Do not ship text-heavy quote art in first drop (especially long-copy posters).
- Do not publish intricate/high-noise artwork that loses clarity on mobile or print.
- Do not use uncanny AI-looking interiors or explicit AI-art positioning in launch creatives.
- Do not use IP-adjacent/fan-art themes or uncertain licensing sources.
- Do not publish SKUs without print-confidence assets (ratio chart + download/print/frame panel).


## Room Types (v1 focus)
- Nursery (primary)
- Kids bedroom (secondary)
- Kids playroom (selective)
- Avoid unrelated adult living rooms/offices/kitchens in early catalog

## Minimum Mockup Set (per SKU)
- Target **6 images** per product (minimum 5):
  1. Hero in-room mockup
  2. Lifestyle nursery shot
  3. Bundle/grid overview
  4. Size/ratio chart
  5. Download → print → frame panel
  6. What’s included/file breakdown

## Tooling Decisions
- **v1 stack:** Canva + Photopea + reusable nursery mockup templates.
- **Asset rule:** Use curated high-resolution nursery backgrounds with consistent perspective.
- **Delivery specs:** PDP images at high resolution (2000px+ long edge where possible), ad creatives in 9:16 (1080×1920 baseline).
- **Scale plan:** Move to custom real-print photography after first validated winners.

## Niche Lock (Execution Guardrail)
- **Current primary niche:** Nursery printable wall kits (calm, cohesive, confidence-led).
- **Secondary niches (deferred):** Kids learning/playroom kits, broader home decor variants.
- **Niche freeze rule:** No expansion beyond primary niche until first 10 SKUs are live and at least one offer/bundle shows repeatable conversion signal.

## Pricing & Margin Guardrails
- **Price architecture (working):** Single = entry tier, Trio = core value tier, Weekend Kit = expansion tier.
- **Decision principle:** Do not add discounts/promotions that compress margin below sustainability threshold.
- **Economics rule:** Pause or rework offers where CPA and support/refund burden indicate negative unit economics.
- **AOV target direction:** Use curated bundles (Trio, then Weekend Kit) to improve blended AOV over single-only mix.

## Creative Cadence (Paid Social)
- **Weekly production baseline:** publish fresh creatives for both transformation and print-confidence angles.
- **Format mix:** prioritize 9:16 short-form video + supporting static/carousel variants.
- **Fatigue trigger:** refresh hooks/visual variants when CTR trends down and CPA trends up for multiple days.
- **Learning loop:** archive winners/losers by hook, archetype, and offer type to guide next production sprint.

- **Resolution order:** help identify correct file → provide corrected/repacked file if needed → refund only if unresolved.

## Analytics Event Map (Minimum)
- **Funnel events:** Product View → Add to Cart → Checkout Started → Purchase.
- **Offer diagnostics:** track conversion by SKU type (Single vs Trio vs Weekend Kit).
- **Creative diagnostics:** track CTR/CPC/CPA by hook and archetype.
- **Support diagnostics:** categorize tickets (download issue, sizing confusion, print quality, licensing confusion).

## Expansion Trigger Table
